# Smart Parking System 🅿️ 🚗

The Smart Parking System is designed to address parking issues in urban areas and university campuses, where parking spots are limited and number of cars is on the rise. This system will help the driver not wasting their time looking for open parking spots. Additionally, there are still many people with a car that does not have the rear parking assist on their car so the Smart Parking Assistant will help the driver parking the car. The system will integrate a mix of digital and analog sensors, motors, LEDs, and an LCD display to manage parking operations.
